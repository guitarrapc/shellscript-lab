# Expanding an array without an index only gives the element in the index 0.

# 1. Simple pattern

If value can create as array, then `"${array[@]}"` is the best way to iterate over it.

## Prolematic code

```sh
myarray=(foo bar)
for f in $myarray; do
  echo "$f"
done
# foo
```

## Fix

Use `while read -r` loop instead of `for` loop, and input redirection instead of command substitution.

```sh
myarray=(foo bar)
for f in "${myarray[@]}"; do
  echo "$f"
done
# foo
# bar
```

# 2. String to array convert Pattern

Simple pattern cannot apply to when converting string to array.

## Prolematic code

When code works fine, but shellcheck warns SC2128 you cannot apply simple pattern.

```sh
myarray=("foo bar")
for f in $myarray; do
  echo "$f"
done
# foo
# bar
```

It breaks array itelation because of array is handled as string.

```sh
myarray=("foo bar")
for f in "${myarray[@]}"; do
  echo "$f"
done
# foo bar
```

## Fix

https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2206 is the correct way to fix it.

Use `IFS=" " read -r -a $variable <<< $input` instead of `(string)` to cast string to array. for loop can iterate over array as simple pattern.

```sh
foo="foo bar"
IFS=" " read -r -a myarray <<< "${foo}"
for f in "${myarray[@]}"; do
  echo "$f"
done
# foo
# bar
```
